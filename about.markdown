I'm a software engineer and leader, with experience in a variety of roles across a range of business types and domains. I advocate for adoption of DevOps practices and in empowering developers to take end-to-end ownership of their changes; from working with users and helping to identify requirements all the way along to deploying, releasing, and monitoring. It will never _not_ be incredibly rewarding to own the successful delivery of a change from inception to release, and then to watch the metrics move in real time üìà

I have a broad knowledge and experience in many of the facets that fall under the vast umbrella of "software engineering", including but certainly not limited to the following:

- From Web and desktop clients to backend REST/gRPC/event-based applications
- From Key-value/relational/document data stores to product analytics funnels and time series analysis
- From Kubernetes hosted on cloud platforms to IIS deployed on bare metal
- From Building out automated CI/CD/infra pipelines ~~to FTPing binaries built on my machine onto the production server and testing manually~~ ü§®

#### My theory on great software engineers üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I like to think that one of traits common to all great people is that **they deeply care about making a difference**. If this trait is present in an engineer, it then follows that they are driven to provide the most value in the most efficient way. They therefore index highly on automation, data-backed decisions, and open communication. This continues to trickle down, ultimately resulting in high quality software that can be iterated on quickly and is loved by users.
